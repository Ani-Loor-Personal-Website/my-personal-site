        <p>I am often doodling on my iPad, most recently working on my Tinder Sketch Diary series where I imortalize fleeting encounters with strange men off the internet into  cute, romanticized illustrations. Keep an eye out for my drawings wheatpasted here and there around Brooklyn. Shoutout to my ex who bought me my iPad and then broke up with me for being an ambitionless loser. </p>

        <h1>Cycling & Running</h1>

        <p>My immigrant parents bullied me into long distance running since I was practically an infant and I've kept it up as a hobby since. I ran competivley till college but now can be found going for a casual jog around the neighborhood. I even joined a running club due to my desperate, crippling need for human interaction. I love cycling as well! Unfortunately you won't see me pushing around because someone in my building stole my bike. </p>

        <h1>Dancing</h1>

        <p>My special hobby! I love all latin dancing including salsa, bachata, merengue, and more. Dance socials have been one of my favorite kinds of events to head to over the past few years. Shameless EDM girlie big into raving. Catch me bopping around to techno, hardstyle, house, and whatever else.</p>
